# Lyric_Idea_Generator

Based on the Lyric WorkSheet from Pat Pattison's fantastic, "Write Better Lyrics" book, Lyric_Scraper will generate synonyms, antonyms, and rhyming words based on a single inputted word.

This program is designed to rapidly return related and rhyming words for the purpose of brainstorming for lyric and songwriting, with the potential to scrape and return over 3000 words from a single inputted word. 

This program will output the results to a text file for easy future reference.
